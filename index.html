        <p> I made these designs to be sold on Design Bundles website. However, because
            of my lack of experience at that time, I failed to cross the basic path of entrance
        to even open my shop there. But no worries, I'm getting better everyday and a day will surely come when I
    will definitely be selling such designs and people will be loving them. These were designed
on Canva and were editable templates. </p>
